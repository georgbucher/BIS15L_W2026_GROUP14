## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(bslib)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
set.seed(123)
plant_joined <- data.frame(
  occupied = sample(c(0, 1), 200, replace = TRUE),
  temperature_ambient = rnorm(200, mean = 20, sd = 5),
  season.x = sample(c("autumn", "spring"), 200, replace = TRUE)
)

ui <- page_sidebar(
  title = "Plant Occupancy by Season",
  sidebar = sidebar(
    radioButtons(
      "season",
      "Select Season:",
      choices = c("Autumn" = "autumn", "Spring" = "spring"),
      selected = "autumn"
    )
  ),
  card(
    card_header("Occupancy Distribution"),
    plotOutput("occupancy_plot")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$occupancy_plot <- renderPlot({
    plant_joined %>% 
      filter(season.x == input$season) %>%
      mutate(occupied = factor(occupied)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = occupied)) +
      geom_bar(aes(fill = season.x), color = "black", position = "dodge") +
      labs(
        x = "Occupied",
        y = "Count",
        fill = "Season"
      ) +
      theme_minimal() +
      theme(text = element_text(size = 14))
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
